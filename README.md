# Machine Learning Project1

## Dataset:
S&P 500 stock data, historical stock data for all current S&P 500 companies. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500)

## Dataset content:
Stock market data can be interesting to analyze and as a further incentive, strong predictive models can have large financial payoff. The amount of financial data on the web is seemingly endless. A large and well structured dataset on a wide array of companies can be hard to come by. Here I provide a dataset with historical stock prices (last 5 years) for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index.

## Machine Learning project purpose:
- Classification of stock price change in each day.
- Using many different ML classification algorithms find the best algorithm.
- Using feature engineering generate new features to improve prediction accuracy. 

## Machine Learning project results:
- It was possible to raise accuracy from 52 to 70% by feature engineering and selecting suitable algorithm.
